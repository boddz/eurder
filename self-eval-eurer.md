# Örder self-checker
Örder is not only an awesome order management application, it is also a great self-evaluation, done by our best junior java developers.
The goal is not to "get it over with", the goal is to learn & grow:
 - Do I grasp the concepts?
 - Which topics do I get? Where can I challenge myself to go the extra mile?
 - Where do I struggle? Which topics should I work on?
 - Do codereviews on your own code. Make it work + improve and refine it. (for inspiration, look at https://switchfully.slack.com/files/UK99TQ0G6/F0100872XJA/codereview.pdf)
## Which choices did you make in your project
